## Technology Stack Recommendations
> Note: These are recommendations. Choose the best tool for each project's specific needs.

### Backend Options
- **Node.js**: Express, Fastify, or Hono for different use cases
- **Python**: FastAPI for data-heavy applications, Django for rapid development
- **Go**: For high-performance microservices
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (default), MongoDB (document-heavy), Redis (caching)
- **Real-time**: Socket.io, WebSockets, or Server-Sent Events

### Frontend Options  
- **React**: With Vite for SPAs, Next.js for full-stack
- **Vue**: For progressive enhancement
- **Svelte**: For performance-critical interfaces
- **Vanilla**: For simple, fast-loading pages
- **Styling**: Tailwind (utility-first), CSS Modules (scoped), or vanilla CSS
- **State**: Zustand (simple), Redux Toolkit (complex), or Context API

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Process Manager**: PM2, systemd, or Docker
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx or Caddy
- **SSL**: Let's Encrypt via Certbot
- **Monitoring**: Custom logging, Prometheus, or lightweight alternatives
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or simple bash scripts

## Server Configuration Notes
- **Ports in use**:
  - 22: SSH
  - 80: HTTP (Nginx)
  - 443: HTTPS (Nginx)
  - [ADD PORTS AS SERVICES ARE DEPLOYED]

## Memory Log
> Update this section with important information, decisions, and completed tasks

### 2025-08-12 - Session 1 Notes
- **What was accomplished**: Environment initialization verified, CONTEXT.md cleaned up
- **Key decisions made**: Removed first-run initialization section as environment is ready
- **Problems solved**: N/A - Initial setup session
- **Knowledge gained**: System is properly initialized with all required directories and knowledge base files
- **Next session should**: Begin with any new projects or tasks from Skander

### 2025-08-12 - Session 2 Notes
- **What was accomplished**: Complete server infrastructure setup including Git, Nginx, PostgreSQL, Redis, PM2, security tools
- **Key decisions made**: 
  - PostgreSQL with secure passwords for postgres and appuser accounts
  - Redis configured with 256MB memory limit and LRU eviction
  - Fail2ban configured for SSH and Nginx protection
  - Created deployment and monitoring scripts for automation
- **Problems solved**: 
  - Configured comprehensive security with UFW firewall and fail2ban
  - Set up performance optimizations for all services
  - Created reusable deployment script for future applications
- **Knowledge gained**: Server is production-ready with all essential services configured and secured
- **Next session should**: Configure DNS records for g8nie.com and enable SSL certificate once DNS propagates 

## Standard Operating Procedures

### Starting a New Session
1. Read this CONTEXT.md file completely
2. Check relevant PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for active projects
3. Review recent entries in knowledge base
4. Continue from last session's "Next session should" notes

### Creating a New Project
1. Create project directory: `mkdir -p /home/claude/projects/[name]`
2. Copy template: `cp /home/claude/templates/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md /home/claude/projects/[name]/`
3. Initialize git repository
4. Update this file's Active Projects section
5. Create initial structure based on project type

### After Completing Work
1. Update relevant PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
2. Add session notes to this file
3. Update knowledge base if you learned something reusable
4. Commit all changes with clear messages
5. Note what the next session should focus on

### When Solving Problems
1. Document the solution in `/home/claude/knowledge/solutions.md`
2. Add reusable code to `/home/claude/knowledge/snippets.md`
3. Update fixes database if it was a bug

### Design Implementation
- Remember: NO generic AI aesthetics
- Avoid blue gradients and excessive rounded corners
- Create unique, memorable interfaces
- Less icons, more thoughtful typography
- Test designs by asking: "Does this look like every other AI-generated interface?"

## Important Reminders
- Always implement Skander's design preferences (no AI-looking interfaces!)
- Choose tech stack based on project needs, not defaults
- Document architectural decisions in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- Keep the knowledge base updated for future reference
- Write code that future-you will understand
- Security and performance are not optional
- Update context files after each session

## Quick Commands Reference
```bash
# Navigate workspace
cd /home/claude

# Start new project with context
cp templates/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md projects/[new-project]/

# View this context
cat /home/claude/CONTEXT.md

# Check knowledge base
ls -la /home/claude/knowledge/

# View today's log
cat logs/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md

# Quick project status
grep -h "Status" projects/*/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
```

## Communication with Skander
- **Reporting style**: Technical but accessible
